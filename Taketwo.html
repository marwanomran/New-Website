### Method 1: Using Localhost with ngrok for Quick Testing
If you're just testing things out quickly, you can use tools like `ngrok` to expose a local server (running on
your PC) to the internet via a secure tunnel. This is useful for debugging and testing before deploying securely.

1. **Download and Install ngrok**: Go to the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the
appropriate version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.
2. **Start ngrok**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to where you installed ngrok, and run:
   ```bash
   ./ngrok http 5000
   ```
   Replace `5000` with whatever port your local server is running on (e.g., if your LLM service runs on port 8000,
you would use `./ngrok http 8000`). This will create a public URL that tunnels to your localhost:5000 or wherever
specified.
3. **Update the HTML**: Use the ngrok URL in place of `'http://your-llm-api-endpoint'`. For example, if ngrok
provides you with a URL like `https://1234-5678-9101.ngrok.io`, use that as your endpoint.

### Method 2: Setting Up a Local Server on Your PC
If you prefer to keep things more secure and manage everything locally, you can set up a small web server on your
PC using Python's SimpleHTTPServer module (available in Python 3). This method is more robust for long-term use.

1. **Start a Local Web Server**:
   - Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory where your HTML file and any other necessary files are located.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     This command starts an HTTP server on port 8000 (or whatever port you prefer). Ensure that your LLM service
is also running on this same machine and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. **Update the HTML**: Use `http://localhost:8000` as your endpoint URL.

### Method 3: Deploying to a Cloud Service
For a more permanent solution, consider deploying your LLM service to a cloud platform that supports web access
(e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or any other serverless/VM-based service). You can then configure your local client to
connect to this remote endpoint securely using HTTPS and appropriate authentication methods if necessary.
